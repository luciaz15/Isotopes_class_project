# Isotopes_class_project
This was my final data project for my isotopes class at Purdue, and one of my first R projects. It might not be perfect and difficult to understand because it has been 4 years ago.

Unfortunately, I don't have the isotopes data anymore but I still have my R script, figures, and report from the project.
